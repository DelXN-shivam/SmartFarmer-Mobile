## Summary

This document outlines the changes made to fix a back navigation issue in the Smart Farmer application. The problem occurred when a user updated their profile data from the edit farmer details screen, which would navigate to the profile view screen. When the user pressed the back button, it would not return to the correct tab on the farmer dashboard.

### Original Implementation

The original implementation used `pushAndRemoveUntil` to navigate from the edit farmer details screen to the profile view screen. This method would remove all previous routes from the navigation stack, causing the back button to not function as expected.

### New Implementation

The new implementation addresses this issue by using a callback function and a standard `push` navigation. Here's how it works:

1.  **Callback Function**: A new `onBack` callback function is passed from the `_buildProfileTab` in the farmer dashboard to the `ProfileViewScreen`.

2.  **Standard Navigation**: Instead of `pushAndRemoveUntil`, a standard `push` is used to navigate to the `ProfileViewScreen`. This preserves the navigation history.

3.  **WillPopScope**: The `ProfileViewScreen` is wrapped in a `WillPopScope`, which calls the `onBack` callback when the back button is pressed. This ensures that the UI switches to the correct tab on the farmer dashboard.

### Code Changes

-   **`lib/screens/common/profile_view_screen.dart`**: Added an `onBack` callback and a `WillPopScope` to handle back navigation.
-   **`lib/screens/farmer/farmer_dashboard_screen.dart`**: Updated the `_buildProfileHeader` method to pass the `onBack` callback to the `ProfileViewScreen`.
-   **`lib/screens/farmer/edit_farmer_details.dart`**: Replaced `pushAndRemoveUntil` with a standard `push` navigation.

### Benefits

-   **Correct Back Navigation**: The back button now navigates to the correct tab on the farmer dashboard.
-   **Preserved Navigation History**: The navigation history is preserved, allowing for a more intuitive user experience.
-   **Improved UI**: The UI switches to the correct tab when the back button is pressed, providing a seamless experience for the user.
